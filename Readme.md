# Cool Lang!
The future Monaden language. ML syntax, functional, experimental!

## Current plan and implementation
Points listed in order of compilation steps. More to come!
* Lexing & parsing using BNFC
* (TODO) Hindley-Milner based type check probably. Might implement a more "type checky" version that requires more explicit typing.
* (TODO) Pattern match coverage checking
* Tree walking interpreter. (TODO) VM with JIT compilation / compile to LLVM/C/Rust, who knows yet?

# External tooling
* (TODO) LSP integration, treesitter syntax highlighting, build tool, automatic case generation
